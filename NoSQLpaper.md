# A Review on NoSQL Databases

## NoSQL Databases: An Overview

- NoSQL, or "Not Only SQL," refers to a family of databases that degined to handle large-scale data workloads.
- It handles large unstructured or semi-structured data.
- Unlike trador semi-structured itional relational databases, which use tables and a fixed schemas to store data, NoSQL dbs are flexible to use.

### 2.1 MongoDB

MongoDB is a document-oriented database that stores data in a JSON-like format called BSON (Binary JSON). This database is designed for high availability, scalability, and flexibility. Its strengths lie in its ability to manage large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data while allowing dynamic schema changes.

Use cases: MongoDB is widely used in e-commerce, content management, and real-time analyticsâ€‹.

There are other examples of NoSQL dbs: Cassandra, Elasticsearch, Neo4j, CouchDB

## 3. Conclusion

In this paper, we have examined about NoSQL databases, only MongoDB, why we require them.
