# Tiny Habits

## Tiny Habits - BJ Fogg

### Most interesting story or idea for you

The video discusses the concept of tiny habits. The speaker, BJ Fogg, argues that in order to make lasting changes in our lives, we should focus on creating small, achievable habits rather than trying to overhaul our entire lives at once. He uses the example of flossing one tooth each day to illustrate this point. By starting with a tiny habit, we can gradually build momentum and make bigger changes over time.

This idea was particularly interesting to me because it seems like a much more sustainable and achievable approach to change than traditional methods that often involve drastic measures and overwhelming goals. The concept of breaking down large goals into smaller, more manageable steps is something that can be applied to many areas of life, not just health and wellness.

I also found the speaker's personal story about using tiny habits to lose weight to be inspiring. It showed that even small changes can have a big impact over time, and that it's possible to make lasting changes without relying on willpower or motivation alone.

## Core Message

### How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P.

The video discusses the concept of B = MAP, which is a formula for understanding human behavior. B stands for behavior, M stands for motivation, A stands for ability, and P stands for prompt. The formula states that in order to perform a desired behavior, you need to have a high enough level of motivation and ability, and you need to be prompted to do the behavior.

The video suggests that in order to make new habits easier, you should focus on making the habit as easy as possible (increasing A), and providing yourself with clear prompts (increasing P). This will make it more likely that you will perform the behavior, even if your motivation is low.

For example, if you want to start a new exercise habit, you could make it easier by choosing a short, simple workout routine. You could also set a specific time each day to exercise, and put your workout clothes out the night before. This will increase your ability to exercise and provide you with a clear prompt to do so.

The video also emphasizes the importance of celebrating your successes, no matter how small. This will help to increase your motivation and make it more likely that you will stick with your new habit.


### The most interesting story or idea

According to the video, celebrating after each successful completion of a habit, also known as "Shining," is critical for habit development because it provides several benefits:

Confidence Boost: Celebrating even tiny wins reinforces your belief in your ability to succeed, motivating you to continue the habit.
Motivation Surge: Celebrating your achievements fuels your motivation to repeat the habit and take on bigger challenges.
Success Momentum: Frequent celebrations, regardless of the size of the success, create momentum and make sticking to the habit easier.
Habit Growth: Celebrating your wins helps the habit take root and grow naturally, similar to nurturing a plant.
Overcoming Challenges: Celebrating your progress keeps you motivated and helps you persevere through obstacles.
Sustainable Change: Making the habit enjoyable and rewarding through celebration increases the likelihood that you'll stick with it in the long run.
In essence, celebrating your successes is a form of positive reinforcement that strengthens the habit loop and makes lasting change more achievable.


## 1% Better Every Day

### The most interesting story or idea

The video discusses the concept of the aggregation of marginal gains, which is the idea that small, incremental improvements can lead to significant results over time. The speaker, James Clear, uses the example of the British Cycling team, which made a series of small changes to their training and equipment, which ultimately led them to become one of the most successful cycling teams in the world.

I found this idea to be particularly interesting because it challenges the traditional notion that success requires a single, dramatic breakthrough. Instead, Clear argues that small, consistent improvements are often the key to achieving significant goals. This idea is applicable to many areas of life, not just sports. For example, if you want to improve your writing skills, you could start by writing for just 10 minutes each day. Over time, these small improvements will add up to significant progress.

I also found the speaker's use of metaphors and storytelling to be engaging and effective. He used the metaphor of a ship to illustrate the idea that small changes can have a big impact over time. He also told stories about the British Cycling team and his own personal journey to build a successful writing habit. These stories helped to bring the concept to life and make it more relatable.


## Atomic Habits

### The book's perspective about Identity

The book argues that identity change is the North Star of habit change. It emphasizes that while outcomes and processes are important, focusing on identity change is crucial for long-term success. The book suggests that by shifting our mindset and beliefs about ourselves, we can create lasting changes in our habits and behaviors. For example, instead of focusing solely on losing weight, we can adopt the identity of a healthy person, which will naturally lead to healthier habits and behaviors.

The book "Atomic Habits" by James Clear outlines several strategies for making habits easier to do:

1. Reduce Friction: Minimize the barriers that prevent you from taking action. For example, if you want to exercise more, keep your workout clothes by your bed so you don't have to search for them in the morning.

2. Increase Friction: Increase the barriers that make it harder to engage in unwanted habits. For example, if you want to reduce your screen time, remove social media apps from your phone's home screen.

3. Make It Obvious: Increase the visibility of your desired habits and decrease the visibility of unwanted habits. For example, keep a healthy snack in plain sight on your kitchen counter, while hiding unhealthy snacks in the pantry.

4. Make It Attractive: Make your desired habits more appealing by associating them with positive rewards or experiences. For example, listen to your favorite music while working out or treat yourself to a delicious meal after completing a task.

5. Make It Easy: Simplify the process of doing your desired habit. Break down complex tasks into smaller, more manageable steps. For example, if you want to write a book, start by writing just one page each day.

6. Make It Satisfying: Make sure that your desired habit is rewarding and enjoyable. This will increase your motivation to stick with it.

7. Stack Habits: Link your desired habit to a current habit that you already do consistently. For example, if you want to start meditating, you could meditate right after brushing your teeth.

8. Environment Matters: Design your environment to support your desired habits. For example, if you want to read more, create a cozy reading nook in your home.

### How to make a habit harder to do?

The book "Atomic Habits" primarily focuses on strategies to make habits easier to do. However, the concept of "friction" can be applied to make habits harder to do.

Here's how the book suggests increasing friction to make a habit harder to do:

Increase Physical Barriers: Make it more difficult to access the cues or rewards associated with the habit. For example, if you want to reduce your screen time, keep your phone in a different room or disable notifications.
Make It More Complex: Introduce additional steps or requirements that make the habit more time-consuming or difficult. This can help reduce the frequency of the habit.
Change Your Environment: Modify your surroundings to make the habit less appealing or convenient. For instance, if you want to stop snacking, remove unhealthy foods from your kitchen.
Associate Unpleasant Consequences: Connect the habit with negative outcomes or feelings. For example, if you want to quit smoking, imagine the health risks and financial costs associated with it.
