# Learning Process

  

## Feynman Technique:

The Feynman Technique is a method of learning by simplifying concepts and explaining them in your own words as if teaching someone else.

  
## What was the most interesting story or idea in the TED talk by Barbara Oakley? 

The most interesting idea was how the brain switches between "focused" and "diffused" modes of thinking, allowing us to better solve complex problems by alternating between intense focus and relaxed, free thinking.

  
## What are active and diffused modes of thinking?

**Active (Focused) Mode:** Concentrated effort on a task, using working memory to solve problems.

**Diffused Mode:** Relaxed, free-flowing thinking, where the brain unconsciously makes connections and solves problems without focused attention.

  
## What are the steps to take when approaching a new topic?

 - Deconstruct the skill into sub-skills.
 - Learn enough to self-correct.
 - Remove barriers to practice.
 - Practice for at least 20 hours.
   

## What are some actions you cActive (Focused) Mode:an take going forward to improve your learning process?


**Maintain focused attention:** Limit distractions by using tools like TimeLimit or Freedom, and keep your phone on silent.

**Time tracking:** Use productivity apps like Boosted to track your time and optimize your workflow.

## Explain concepts in your own words: Practice the Feynman Technique to deeply understand and explain software concepts.

Implement what you learn: Apply concepts in code or design to solidify your understanding.

Set and adhere to deadlines: Use deadlines to allocate time to topics, focusing on concepts and making the learning process enjoyable.
