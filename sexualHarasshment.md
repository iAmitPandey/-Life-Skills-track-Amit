# Sexual Harassment Overview:

Sexual harassment refers to any unwelcome verbal, visual, or physical conduct of a sexual nature that is severe or pervasive, which affects working conditions or creates a hostile work environment. It can take many forms and may involve a wide range of behaviors that violate workplace policies and individual rights.

## Forms of Sexual Harassment:

### Verbal Harassment:

- Comments about a person’s clothing or body.

- Sexual or gender-based jokes or remarks.
- Requests for sexual favors or repeatedly asking someone out.
- Sexual innuendos or threats.
- Spreading rumors about a person’s personal or sexual life.
- Using obscene language that is sexual in nature.\*

### Visual Harassment:

- Obscene posters, drawings, or pictures displayed in the workplace.
- Sharing or showing sexually inappropriate materials (e.g., photos, videos).

### Physical Harassment:

- Sexual assault or any unwanted physical contact.
- Impeding or blocking movement in a way that is sexual in nature.
- Inappropriate touching, such as kissing, hugging, patting, or stroking.
- Sexual gestures or leering at someone’s body.

## Quid Pro Quo:

"Quid pro quo" harassment occurs when a person in authority, such as a supervisor, demands sexual favors in exchange for workplace benefits like promotions, raises, or job security. It creates an unfair work environment where employees feel coerced or forced to comply.

## Hostile Work Environment:

A hostile work environment is created when pervasive, inappropriate behavior, language, or images make the workplace intimidating, offensive, or abusive for an employee. This can include repeated unwelcome sexual advances, comments, or actions that interfere with the individual's ability to work or feel safe.

To prevent sexual harassment, employers should create and enforce strict anti-harassment policies, offer training, and provide avenues for victims to report incidents safely and confidentially.
