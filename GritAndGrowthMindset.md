# Grit and Growth Mindset

## Grit

Leaving a high-flying job in consulting, Angela Lee Duckworth took a job teaching math to seventh graders in a New York public school. She quickly realized that IQ wasn't the only thing separating the successful students from those who struggled. Here, she explains her theory of "grit" as a predictor of success...

Grit refers to a person's perseverance and passion for long-term goals. It involves maintaining effort and interest over years, even in the face of challenges, setbacks, and plateaus. People with grit are resilient, consistent, and remain motivated to achieve their goals despite obstacles, as they value long-term achievements over short-term satisfaction.

## Introduction to Growth Mindset

A growth mindset is the belief that abilities and intelligence can be developed through dedication, learning, and effort. People with a growth mindset embrace challenges, persist in the face of setbacks, and view failure as a learning opportunity. This contrasts with a fixed mindset, where individuals believe their abilities are static and unchangeable. The growth mindset encourages continuous improvement and resilience, fostering personal and professional development over time.


## Understanding Internal Locus of Control

An internal locus of control refers to the belief that individuals have control over the outcomes of their lives through their own actions, decisions, and efforts. People with an internal locus of control attribute their successes or failures to personal responsibility, rather than external factors like luck or fate. This mindset fosters self-empowerment and accountability, as individuals feel they can influence their future by making choices and taking action. It contrasts with an external locus of control, where outcomes are seen as being outside one's control.


## How to build a Growth Mindset

Building a growth mindset involves several key practices:

* Embrace Challenges: View challenges as opportunities to learn and grow rather than obstacles.
* Learn from Failure: See mistakes as part of the learning process, and use them to improve.
* Effort Equals Improvement: Believe that hard work and effort lead to mastery.
* Accept Feedback: Use constructive criticism to grow and refine your skills.
* Stay Persistent: Keep going despite setbacks, focusing on long-term growth instead of immediate success.

## Ideas to take action and build Growth Mindset

* Set Learning Goals: Focus on what you want to learn rather than just outcomes.
* Practice Self-Reflection: Regularly evaluate your progress and areas for improvement.
* Surround Yourself with Growth-Oriented People: Engage with others who challenge and inspire growth.
* Reward Effort, Not Just Results: Celebrate hard work and persistence, even if you don’t achieve the desired result.
* Adopt a “Not Yet” Attitude: When facing setbacks, tell yourself you haven’t succeeded yet—and keep going.
